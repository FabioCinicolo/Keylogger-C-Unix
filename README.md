<H2 id="Usage"> Usage </H2>

<H3 id="Compiling"> Compiling </H3>

In order to compile the program, run this command: 
```c

gcc main.c keylogger.c daemon.c -o daemon-keylogger

```

<H3 id="Arguments"> Command line arguments </H3>

You can invoke the executable in two possible ways:
<ul>
  <li>&lt<b>executable_path</b>&gt &lt<b>host</b>&gt &lt<b>port</b>&gt &lt<b>is_single_instance</b>&gt</li>
  <li>&lt<b>executable_path</b>&gt &lt<b>file_path</b>&gt &lt<b>is_single_instance</b>&gt</li>
</ul>
Where:
<ul>
  <li><b>executable_path</b>: path of the executable</li>
  <li><b>host</b> and <b>port</b>: respectively the hostname or ip address and the port of the server you want to send the events to</li>
  <li><b>file_path</b>: path of the regular file you want to store events into</li> 
  <li><b>is_single_instance</b>: 1 if you only want an instance of the daemon running at a time, 0 otherwise</li>
</ul>
Running examples: <code>./daemon-keylogger 127.0.0.1 12345 0</code> or <code>./daemon-keylogger file_out.txt 1</code>.

<H3 id="Keylogger"> Keylogger </H3>

<H4 id="Idea"> General idea </H4>
First of all, you have to specify where to send the events, to a server or locally in a regular file, and you also have to choose between allowing multiple instances of the daemon to run simultaneously (for example, you may want to send events to multiple servers) or having just one copy of the daemon running. However, i added this option just for practice rather than for a particular useful purpose :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:. If the daemon is single instance, before starting the keylogger module, we have to check if another copy of this daemon is already running, in such case the program simply exits. After that, the keyboard device driver is looked for, the socket or the file is opened and the keylogging phase begins. The program consists of 5 main parts:
<ol>
  <li><b>Daemonize process</b>: In this phase, the process is converted into a daemon, which is a process that doesn't have a controlling terminal, for this reason it runs in the background. </li>
  <li><b>Guarantee single instance</b>: If you specified to have a single instance daemon, the program has to assure that another copy is not already running, in that case a write lock on a particular file is obtained.</li>
  <li><b>Find keyboard device driver</b>: It looks for the keyboard device driver into <b>/dev/input/</b>.</li>
  <li><b>Open connection or file</b>: If you choose to send events to a server, a connection with it must be established, if you choose to save events locally, the file has to be opened. </li>
  <li><b>Keylog</b>: Reads keypress events from the keyboard device driver and sends them to server or file. </li>
</ol>

<H4 id="Finding"> Finding keyboard device </H4>
The <b>event interface</b> exposes the raw events to userspace through a collection of character device nodes, one character device node per logical input device(keyboard, mouse, joystick, power buttons, ..). Those device files can be found into <b>/dev/input/</b>.

The function <code>int findKeyboardDevice(char \*dir_path)</code> has the task of exploring devices and subdirectories(by calling itself recursively if current file is a directory) and returns the first keyboard device it finds, if any. How do we check if a character device is actually a keyboard one? We can use the event API (<b>EVIOC* functions</b>), which will allow us to query the capabilities and characteristics of an input device.
Take a look at a function that uses the linux event API to check whether or not an input device is a keyboard device:

```c
   
int isKeyboardDevice(char *path, int *keyboard_device)
{
    int32_t events_bitmask = 0;
    int32_t keys_bitmask = 0;
    int32_t keys = KEY_Q | KEY_A | KEY_Z | KEY_1 | KEY_9;
    int fd;

    fd = open(path, O_RDONLY);

    if (fd < 0)
        return 0;

    if (ioctl(fd, EVIOCGBIT(0, sizeof(events_bitmask)), &events_bitmask) >= 0)
    {
        if ((events_bitmask & EV_KEY) == EV_KEY)
        {
            if (ioctl(fd, EVIOCGBIT(EV_KEY, sizeof(keys_bitmask)), &keys_bitmask) >= 0)
                if ((keys & keys_bitmask) == keys)
                {
                    *keyboard_device = fd;
                    return 1;
                }
        }
    }
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}

```

The first ioctl call allows us to get the event bits, that is, a bitmask expressing all of the capabilities or features supported by the device, it can tell us if, for example, the device has keys or buttons or if it is a mouse.
If EV_KEY bit is set then we have found a device that has keys or buttons, but we cannot yet be sure that it is a keyboard! A power button will have this bit set but it is not obviously a keyboard. 
However, EVIOCGBIT permits us to make more precise queries about the specific device features, in our case, the second ioctl call, will allow us to know if the device supports "q", "a", "z", "1" and "9", if so, we can almost be sure that it is a keyboard device.

<H4 id="Reading"> Reading events </H4>
Retrieving events from a device requires a standard character device â€œread" function. Each time you read from an event device you will get a number of events. Every event consists of a struct input_event. If you wish to know more about input_event fields, give a look at https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/event-codes.txt.

```c

struct input_event {
      struct timeval time;
      unsigned short type;
      unsigned short code;
      unsigned int value; 
      };

```

When trying to read from the keyboard device you may not get exactly what you would expect, that is, a unique event containing the code of the key you have just pressed. This happens because, generally, a single hardware event is mapped into multiple "software" input events. This is what happens if I try to read from the keyboard device after pressing the letter "a":

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75443422/177127789-686ff558-e1cc-4a9d-85b2-ea77ba325387.png)

As you can see, a single key press has generated six input events. Let us take a look at each of those events:
<ol>
<li>Type = 4 indicates an EV_MSC event, which according to the documentation is used to describe miscellaneous input data that do not fit into other types. From what my understanding is, it returns in the "value" field the device specific scan code, so, we are not really interested in it, because we could get wrong key codes if user remaps the keys. It is not completely useless though, it could be used to recognize which specific physical buttons are being pressed.</li>
<li>This is the event we are mostly interested in. It has type = EV_KEY, which tells us that a key has either been pressed, released or repeated,  value = 1 tells us that a key has been pressed and code = "30" represents the KEY_A key, which is in fact the key I pressed.</li>
<li>Type = 0 indicates an EV_SYN event, which is simply used to separate different hardware events.</li><br>
<//ol>
The other three events generated are almost the same as the first three, they are associated to the hardware event of "releasing a key". If you take a look at the fifth event, you can see that we have an EV_KEY event with value = 0 that represents a key release, in this case, of the letter "a".<br>
<em>In my program, only key press events will be captured, so, events whose type = EV_KEY and value = 1.</em>

<H4 id="Signals">Signals handling</H4>
As soon as the process is daemonized, all signals are blocked. According to the file you choose to send the events to, particular signals will be unblocked. They will allow us to terminate the daemon safely(recall that daemon processes do not have controlling terminal, so the user cannot send, for example, SIGINT via CTRL-C).
<ul>
<li>If you choose to send events to a server, then SIGPIPE is unblocked. If the server closed the connection and the daemon tries to send bytes to the server, the send() system call will be interrupted by SIGPIPE and will fail, setting errno to EPIPE, this happens because an RST packet is received from the server, that is telling the program that it is not interested in receiving any more bytes.</li>
<li>If you choose to save events locally, then SIGTERM is unblocked. I choose SIGTERM just because it is the default signal sent by the kill command.
  <ul>
    <li>If SIGTERM is received when daemon is blocked on the read system call, read() fails with EINTR set as errno.</li>
    <li>It SIGTERM is received when daemon is writing on file and no bytes were written, write() fails with EINTR set a as errno.</li>
    <li>It SIGTERM is received when daemon is writing on file and at least a byte was written, write() returns the number of bytes written. The handler has, however, set       the STOP_KEYLOGGER flag to 1, so as soon as the write writes all the remaining events into the file, the loop of the keylogger will be interrupted</li>
  </ul>

<em>Both signals share the same event handler</em>, which is set by the sigaction system call. It just sets a flag named STOP_KEYLOGGER to 1, which stops the keylogger() main loop.

<H3 id="Daemon"> Daemon process </H3>
I thought that it would be nice having the keylogger running in background under not the direct control of the user. For this reason I choose to implement the program as a daemon process.
<H4 id="Daemonize">Daemonizing phase </H4>
In this phase, the process is converted to a daemon. The code I used is a slight variation of the code from the "Advanced programming in the Unix Environment 3rd edition" book, provided in the "Daemon Processes" section. I added a few comments that explain all the steps required to daemonize a process, so I'll just leave the daemonize function here:

```c

int daemonize()
{
    pid_t pid;
    struct rlimit limit;

    umask(0); /* Resetting process file mode creation mask */

    if (getrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &limit) < 0) /* Getting max number of file descriptors that process can open. */
        return 0;

    pid = fork(); /* Parent exits, Child inherits session and process group id of the terminated parent. Child is now orphane and is attached to init process. */
    if (pid < 0)
        return 0;
    if (pid)
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);

    setsid(); /* A new session is created. Child becomes leader of the session and of a new process group, it is detached from the parent's controlling terminal */

    pid = fork(); /* After the first fork, the process could still be take control of a TTY because it is the session leader!.
                    This fork will generate a new child which will not be the session leader anymore. We have successfully daemonized our process. */
    if (pid < 0)
        return 0;
    if (pid)
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);

    /* chdir("/");  Changes the working directory to a safe one. */

    if (limit.rlim_max == RLIM_INFINITY)
        limit.rlim_max = 1024;

    for (int i = 0; i < limit.rlim_max; i++) /* Closing all file descriptors */
        close(i);

    return 1;
}

```

<H4 id="Single">Single instance daemon and file locking</H4>
User can decide to run the process as a single instance daemon. To ensure that only a copy of the daemon runs at a time, the daemon itself creates a file with a fixed name (in our case, "keylogger-daemon.pid") and places a write lock on the entire file, and also writes its pid in it. If other processes want to acquire a write lock on that particular file, they will fail in the intent because another daemon already owns the lock, that is, another instance of the same daemon is already running. This is the function that checks whether or not another instance is already running, if it is not the case, it returns the locked file:
  
```c
  
int daemonAlreadyRunning(int *lock_file)
{
    char buf[16];
    int fd = open(LOCKFILE, O_RDWR | O_CREAT, LOCKMODE); /* Opening file */
    if (fd < 0)                                          /* If open went wrong */
        return 2;
    if (lockfile(fd) < 0) /* If lockfile went wrong */
    {
        if (errno == EACCES || errno == EAGAIN) /* If lockfile failed with errno set to EACCESS or EAGAIN
                                                   it means that the lock has already been running so another is  daemon is running */
        {
            close(fd);
            return 1;
        }
        close(fd);
        return 2;
    }
    /* If Daemon acquired write lock, writes its pid into the locked file */
    ftruncate(fd, 0);
    sprintf(buf, "%ld", (long)getpid());
    write(fd, buf, strlen(buf) + 1);
    *lock_file = fd;
    return 0;
}

  ```
  
<H3 id="Log"> Syslog </H3>
Daemon processes do not own a controlling terminal, so we cannot log error or info messages directly to standard output or standard error. For this reason, the syslog(3) function is used to log messages into /var/log/syslog. 
Here is what happens if we <code>run tail -f /var/log/syslog</code> after running the daemon:

<H3 id="Server"> Server </H3>
It is a simple server which logs keypress events, to its standard output. I choose single threading because this server is not meant to serve a large amount of clients, but just to listen for keyboard events from a few clients.

<H4 id="IO"> IO/Multiplexing with poll() </H4>

Read operations could block indefinitely, for example when the user on the client side is not pressing any keys for a long time. This behaviour would make our main thread block, thus resulting in not being able to accept new clients. For this reason, we mark the sockets to be non-blocking. In addition to that, we use the poll system call that allows the thread to be notified by the kernel whenever particular events occurr(socket readable, in our case). As soon as we read everything, the read will not block but will, instead, fail and errno will be set to EWOULDBLOCK/EAGAIN, allowing the main thread to regain control. 

<H4 id="Logging"> Logging events session example </H4>
Events are printed in this format : <b>"IP: &ltIP&gt - Time: &ltTIME_SEC&gt - Key: &ltKEY&gt"</b>.Let us look at an example of server receiving events from two clients:

I have developed this program just to learn about the linux input subsystem and to put in practice notions I have acquired during the operating systems class. You shall not run this program on machines where you don't have permissions to log key presses.
